Tasked to  evaluate the following function call myMean.

INPUT:
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) { return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2)) }

result <- myMean(assignment2)
cat("Mean of assignment2:", result)

OUTPUT:
Mean of assignment2: 18.25

Explanation:

The function myMean takes a vector assignment2 as its input. 
Inside the function, it calculates the mean by summing up all the values in the vector (sum(assignment2)) and dividing the sum by the length of the vector (length(assignment2)).
The result is then returned by the function.
This function calculates the mean of the values in the vector assignment2 correctly. You can test it with the provided dataset and get the mean of the values.
